            <h2>What Is a Spacewalk?</h2>
            <p>Any time an astronaut gets out of a vehicle while in space, it is called a spacewalk. A spacewalk is also called an EVA. EVA stands for extravehicular activity.

                The first person to go on a spacewalk was Alexei Leonov. He was from Russia. The first spacewalk was on March 18, 1965. It was 10 minutes long.
                
                The first American to go on a spacewalk was Ed White. His spacewalk was on June 3, 1965, during the Gemini 4 mission. White's spacewalk lasted 23 minutes.
                
                Today, astronauts go on spacewalks outside the International Space Station. Spacewalks usually last between five and eight hours, depending on the job.
                
                The world record for the most spacewalks is held by Russian astronaut Anatoly Solovyev. He has been on 16 spacewalks and spent more than 82 hours outside
                
                in space. That's almost 3 Â½ days of walking in space! NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria holds the U.S. record for the most spacewalks. He has done 10 
                
                spacewalks and spent more than 67 hours.</p>
